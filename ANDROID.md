### Want to normalize mp3 files in your Android device?

I was able to use this script to normalize mp3 files in my Android device, but I can't guarantee that it will work on every Android device. Regardless, I will detail the steps I took for my device running Android 7.0 Nougat to normalize mp3 files in an Android device and still leave *Most Played*, *Recently Played*, *Recently Added*, and playlists intact.
