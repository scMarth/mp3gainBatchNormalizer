This is a simple batch script that uses mp3gain to normalize mp3 files to a fixed target volume of 95 dB. This batch script works on mp3 files with Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters in the filenames, which mp3gain currently does not support.

Usage:

1.) Copy "normalize_to_95db.bat" and "mp3gain.exe" into the desired folder
2.) Drag and drop the mp3 files that you want to adjust onto "normalize_to_95db.bat"
